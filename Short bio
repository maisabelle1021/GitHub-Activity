Hi! I'm Ma. Isabelle Balansag, I am 21 years old and I am currently an ECE student. I like to listen to KPOP and watch JoJo's Bizarre
Adventures. Whenever I get bored, I either do one of the two things I mentioned earlier, or go edit videos. Some may find it strange
that I think editing is relaxing, but it is for me. I took up ECE because my father is an electronics engineer too and I wanted to 
walk down the same path as him.
